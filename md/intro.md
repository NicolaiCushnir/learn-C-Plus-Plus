### Pros and at Cons in C++ : 

**Pros:**

* A galore of compilers and libraries to work with [C++]
* Eases accessing blocked or hidden objects by other programming languages [C]
* Faster execution of programs than most programming languages [C/C++]
* Forms the basis for understanding more complex programming languages [C/C++]
* Language of choice for multi-device, multi-platform app development [C++]
* Offers a great degree of portability [C]
* Procedure-oriented language with a group of function modules and blocks. These make debugging, testing, and maintaining the programs easier [C]
* Programs are more efficient and easy to understand [C/C++]
* Rich function library [C++]
* Runs close to the system hardware and hence, offers a low level of abstraction [C/C++]
* Support exception handling and function overloading [C++]
* Wide variety of application domains, such as games, GUI applications, and real-time mathematical simulations [C++]

**Cons:**

* Complex syntax, ahaha :D. [C/C++]. Nonsense this is wrong. C++ seem like javascript. So what does it mean a plus. I'll tell you a secret Python is more difficulty than C++. And what is more I hate Python. it must burn in hell. The main thing you should know is that the algorithms are the same in all languages. **+1**
* Doesnâ€™t support program namespace [C]. For me this is plus. **+1**
* Incapable of solving modern, real-world programming challenges [C] **?**
* Less efficient object-oriented system compared to other OOP-based programming languages [C++] **maybe**
* Need to manually create the high-level constructs [C]  Good. There is already exist the high-level constructs, don't worry. **+1**
* No garbage collection or dynamic memory allocation [C/C++]. Very well, not buggy and does not slow down but flies like the wind. This is stupid item. **+1**
* No run-time checking [C/C++]
* No strict type checking [C]
* Not an easy first-choice for learning programming [C/C++]
* Plagued by the issues of buffer overflow and memory corruption [C/C++]
* Smaller standard library [C]
