### Why C++ for me :
* Back End Develop - High Performance
* For White Hack - –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–º–∏ —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞–º–∏ –¥–ª—è –∑–ª–æ–º–∞ –∏ —Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–µ–¥–ª–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏.
* Maybe - For Network, App. And even why not, Wi-Fi 1km. Radius. :D
* Games - Probably something like Strong Hold Crusader
* Learn Security
* Maybe create a new language Programming ? With My own Compile, without OOP. Only Zero Abstraction ? ü§î
* Envoy - Maybe to help improve this web server which was wrote in C++. But i presume that must use before something period.
